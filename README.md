# STM32H723_Nucleo_Cube_AI_Multi_Model_Example

**This is one of many ways to use Multi model in STM32Cube.AI.** </br>

This is an example of how to Create, Init and Inference each model for 2 sample keras models.</br>

* using STM32H723 Nucleo board and X-CUBE-AI v7.2.0 with STM32CubeIDE </br>
* example Simple Model info </br>
* Keras model, input shape : (13,) and 3 Dense layer, 13 Attribute and 1 class ( Numerical ) </br>
* In the source code, it is divided into 'model_1' and 'model_2'. </br>
* Because it is a simple example, the accuracy of the model used is low. </br>
* In the source code automatically generated by STM32CubeMX, only the app_x-cube-ai.c file was simply modified. </br>
